                    A surface-to-air missile (SAM), or ground-to-air missile, is a missile designed to be launched from the ground to destroy aircraft or other missiles. It is one type of antiaircraft system; in modern armed forces, missiles have replaced most other forms of dedicated antiaircraft weapons, with anti-aircraft guns pushed into specialized roles. Examples for ground and naval air missiles are the Raytheon Standard Missile 2, Raytheon Standard Missile 6 at Arleigh Burke-class destroyer of the United States Navy, or the MBDA Aster Missile at ships of the british Royal Navy like the Type 45 destroyer and ships of the French Navy like the Horizon-class frigate.

                        Surveillance is the monitoring of behavior, activities, or information for the purpose of influencing, managing or directing. This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment, such as closed-circuit television (CCTV), or interception of electronically transmitted information, such as Internet traffic. It can also include simple technical methods, such as human intelligence gathering and postal interception.

                    Missile defense capabilities play a key role in regional and international security issues. Assessing the impact that different missile defense architectures can have on regional and global stability requires both a technical understanding of the systems and political knowledge of current and past security relationships. CISAC's scientists and social scientists bring the necessary range of disciplinary expertise to the study of these pressing issues. (Papers and presentations in this field can also be found on this website's research section under 'Science and technology.')
